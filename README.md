# Tableau COVID-19 Visualization Project

## Overview

This project focuses on creating an interactive dashboard using Tableau to visualize key insights from COVID-19 data. The dashboard is constructed using four distinct SQL queries, each designed to extract and analyze crucial information related to the global impact of the pandemic. The queries provide insights into global COVID-19 numbers, the percentage of the population infected per country, total deaths by continent, and the overall percentage of the population infected.

The resulting Tableau dashboard offers a comprehensive view of the pandemic's effects across different regions, enabling users to explore and compare data interactively. This visualization helps in understanding the spread and severity of COVID-19, as well as identifying trends and patterns in the data.

## Features

- **Global Numbers**: Presents the total number of COVID-19 cases and deaths worldwide, providing a snapshot of the pandemic's global impact.
  
- **Percent Population Infected per Country**: Displays the percentage of each country's population that has been infected, highlighting regions with the highest infection rates.
  
- **Total Deaths per Continent**: Aggregates and visualizes the total number of COVID-19 deaths by continent, allowing for easy comparison between regions.
  
- **Percent Population Infected**: Shows the overall percentage of the global population that has been infected with COVID-19, providing a clear metric of the virus's reach.

## Project Structure

- **SQL Queries**: Includes four key SQL queries used to extract data for visualization in Tableau.
- **Tableau Dashboard**: The final dashboard, created in Tableau, which visualizes the extracted data in an interactive format.
- **Data Source**: The project utilizes data sourced from [Your Data Source Link Here].
